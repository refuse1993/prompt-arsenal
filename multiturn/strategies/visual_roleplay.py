Visual-RolePlay Attack Strategy

Based on: "Visual-RolePlay: Universal Jailbreak Attack on MultiModal Large Language Models
          via Role-playing Image Character" (2024)
Success Rate: 85%+ ASR, outperforms baselines by 14.3% margin

핵심 아이디어:
1. LLM으로 "high-risk character" 설명 생성
2. Text-to-Image로 캐릭터 이미지 생성 (또는 텍스트 기반 설명 이미지)
3. Benign role-play instruction + character image로 유해 콘텐츠 유도
